# AI-Powered Caloric Expenditure Prediction

## Project Overview
This AI-driven project predicts the caloric burn based on user activity, leveraging machine learning algorithms to provide accurate and personalized health insights.

## Functionality and Correctness
- **Core Algorithms**: Implements Linear Regression, RandomForest, GBM, and XGBRegressor.
- **Expected Results**: The application predicts caloric expenditure post-exercise.

## Installation
Install dependencies with:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Clone the Repository
```
git glone https://github.com/juanmatias12/Calories-Burned
```
## Usage
Train models and evalute their performance with: 
```
python main.py
```

Run the Streamlit application for use:
```
streamlit run application.py
```
## Data and Methodology
* Preprocessing: Clean, normalize, and encode the dataset.
* Algorithms: Employed various regression models for prediction tasks.
* Experimental Results
* Model performance assessed using Mean Absolute Error (MAE), with detailed insights into each model's accuracy.

## Visualization
Visual aids like histograms and scatter plots are used to illustrate the model's predictions versus actual values.

## Discussion
Discusses AI's predictive power, the variability in physical activities, and the robustness to outliers.

## Conclusion and Learning Experience
Reflects on AI's potential in the health and fitness industry, highlighting personal growth and project contributions.

## Real-World Application
Demonstrates a Streamlit app that uses the XGBRegressor for real-world user predictions.
